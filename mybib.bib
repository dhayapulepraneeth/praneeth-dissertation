abstract = {Malicious websites are increasing in abundance, which brings serious web security threats to users. As a result, individuals lose their assets, values, information, etc. to unauthorized parties and become victims while visiting such websites. The research community put efforts into developing effective and efficient models for detecting malicious URLs to make available notifications about websites that users access. Perceiving this, numerous methods make use of various types of machine learning (ML) approaches. However, until now, no technique has perfectly detected malicious URLs, as they are susceptible to false positive and false negative decisions in classifying URLs in malicious and non-malicious groups. To improve this issue, this article proposes a new approach based on a machine learning technique. The proposed approach uses multiple classifiers (i.e., ensemble learning) to predict the class probabilities of URLs and then applies a threshold to filter the decisions of multiple classifiers. Next, the decisions are combined concerning its corresponding class probabilities and find the class label with the highest class probability as the final decision on unlabeled URLs. The results show that the proposed method offers better performance in terms of malicious URL detection than other methods.}

abstract="In recent years, phishing has become an increasing threat in the cyberspace, especially with the increasingly use of messaging and social networks. In traditional phishing attack, users are motivated to visit a bogus website which is carefully designed to look like exactly to a famous banking, e-commerce, social networks, etc., site for getting some personal information such as credit card numbers, usernames, passwords, and even money. Lots of the phishers usually make their attacks with the help of emails by forwarding to the target website. Inexperienced users (even the experienced ones) can visit these fake websites and share their sensitive information. In a phishing attack analysis of 45 countries in the last quarter of 2016, China, Turkey and Taiwan are mostly plagued by malware with the rate of 47.09{\%}, 42.88{\%} and 38.98{\%}. Detection of a phishing attack is a challenging problem, because, this type of attacks is considered as semantics-based attacks, which mainly exploit the computer user's vulnerabilities. In this paper, a phishing detection system which can detect this type of attacks by using some machine learning algorithms and detecting some visual similarities with the help of some natural language processing techniques. Many tests have been applied on the proposed system and experimental results showed that Random Forest algorithm has a very good performance with a success rate of 97.2{\%}.",

title = "Phishing URL Detection Using URL Ranking",
abstract = "The openness of the Web exposes opportunities for criminals to upload malicious content. In fact, despite extensive research, email based spam filtering techniques are unable to protect other web services. Therefore, a counter measure must be taken that generalizes across web services to protect the user from phishing host URLs. This paper describes an approach that classifies URLs automatically based on their lexical and host-based features. Clustering is performed on the entire dataset and a cluster ID (or label) is derived for each URL, which in turn is used as a predictive feature by the classification system. Online URL reputation services are used in order to categorize URLs and the categories returned are used as a supplemental source of information that would enable the system to rank URLs. The classifier achieves 93-98% accuracy by detecting a large number of phishing hosts, while maintaining a modest false positive rate. URL clustering, URL classification, and URL categorization mechanisms work in conjunction to give URLs a rank.",

abstract = {The impact of upstream and downstream process fluctuations in bioprocesses becomes more pronounced during technology transfer of pilot scale processes into large-scale facilities. Mismatches in equipment sizes upon scale-up combined with process fluctuations can lead to discarding expensive product. Understanding and predicting the root causes of product loss is critical to determining the necessary facility modifications required to meet manufacturing targets. In this work, a decision tree classification method, CART (classification and regression tree), was used to interrogate stochastic Monte Carlo simulation datasets that mimic batch fluctuations in industrial biopharmaceutical batch processes. The resulting binary decision tree not only reveals the impact of process fluctuations on product mass loss but also extracts a series of if-then rules on the critical combinations of factors that lead to unacceptable mass loss levels. The decision tree analysis therefore allows rapid prediction of the likelihood of facility fit issues as well as the batch characteristics that result in product loss.}

    abstract = "In pursuit of the perfect supervised NLP classifier, razor thin margins and low-resource test sets can make modeling decisions difficult. Popular metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, and Recall are often insufficient as they fail to give a complete picture of the model{'}s behavior. We present a probabilistic extension of Precision, Recall, and F1 score, which we refer to as confidence-Precision (cPrecision), confidence-Recall (cRecall), and confidence-F1 (cF1) respectively. The proposed metrics address some of the challenges faced when evaluating large-scale NLP systems, specifically when the model{'}s confidence score assignments have an impact on the system{'}s behavior. We describe four key benefits of our proposed metrics as compared to their threshold-based counterparts. Two of these benefits, which we refer to as robustness to missing values and sensitivity to model confidence score assignments are self-evident from the metrics{'} definitions; the remaining benefits, generalization, and functional consistency are demonstrated empirically.",

abstract = {Coronary illness has a wide range of conditions that influences the heart. It is one of the most complex disorders to predict because of the number of components in the body that could prompt it. Distinguishing and anticipating it are challenging for specialists and analysts. If we analyze deaths caused by those that were avoidable those from other reasons in India, the third most prevalent cause of unnecessary death is due to heart attack. Across the globe, number of these types of death may increase to more than 23.6 million by 2030. Around 80% of deaths caused by heart attack occur mainly to younger people. This chapter supports medical specialists in detecting and predicting heart disease by attaining precision levels, as well as in prescribing effective medicine according to the disease findings. Given sensor data, deep learning algorithms are applied along with neural network, random forest, and decision tree classifiers to analyze patients' data to predict heart disease. The experiment shows that the prediction of heart disease has promising results with about 90% accuracy.}
